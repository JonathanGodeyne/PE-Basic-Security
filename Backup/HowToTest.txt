To create keys, encrypt, and decrypt
	Click the "Create Keys" button. The label displays the key name and shows that it is a full key pair.

	Click the "Export Public Key" button. Note that exporting the public key parameters does not change the current key.

	Click the "Encrypt File" button and select a file.

	Click the "Decrypt File" button and select the file just encrypted.

Examine the file just decrypted.

	Close the application and restart it to test retrieving persisted key containers in the next scenario.

To encrypt using the public key
	Click the "Import Public Key" button. The label displays the key name and shows that it is public only.

	Click the "Encrypt File" button and select a file.

	Click the "Decrypt File" button and select the file just encrypted. This will fail because you must have the private key to decrypt.

This scenario demonstrates having only the public key to encrypt a file for another person. Typically that person would give you only the public key and withhold the private key for decryption.

To decrypt using the private key
	Click the "Get Private Key" button. The label displays the key name and shows whether it is the full key pair.

	Click the "Decrypt File" button and select the file just encrypted. This will be successful because you have the full key pair to decrypt.
